# Timestamp Dependence

### Description
Contracts that depend on block timestamps for critical operations are susceptible to manipulation, as miners can slightly adjust the timestamps.

### Impact
This can lead to unfair advantages in games, easier puzzle solutions, and flawed randomness, all of which an attacker can exploit.

### Steps to Fix
1. Avoid reliance on `block.timestamp` or `now` for crucial contract functionalities.
2. Use `block.number` for time-keeping if needed, as it is harder to manipulate.

### Example
In a betting smart contract, if the outcome depends on a timestamp (like an even or odd timestamp deciding the winner), a miner could potentially manipulate the timestamp to affect the result.
